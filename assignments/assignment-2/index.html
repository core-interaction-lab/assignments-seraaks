                        Imagine flying in a plane over Antarctica, the southernmost continent and the coldest and driest region on earth. From the air, you see that it covers a huge area, about 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles), about half the size of the United States. Antarctica is just slightly larger than another continent in the southern hemisphere, Australia.

You also see that it is quite mountainous. Antarctica has an average elevation of 2,300 meters (6,500 feet) making it the highest continent on Earth.

As your plane circles over the landscape, you note that Antarctica is divided into unequal eastern and western portions by the Transantarctic Mountain chain, which is about 100 million years old. East Antarctica is a platform about 1,600 feet (488 meters) above sea level, composed of rocks more than 550 million years old, with younger rocks on top.

                        West Antarctica lies south of South America. The land in West Antarctica is lower than in the east, and in some places is even well below sea level. The continent’s highest peak, Vinson Massif, is found in West Antarctica. It is located on the coast and is 4,876 meters (16,000 feet) tall.

Under the surface of Antarctica, all is not cold and quiet. In fact, there is an active volcano in Antarctica: Mount Erebus, which is 3,794 meters (12,447 feet) in height, is located in East Antarctica, on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf—a place where ice extends far out over the ocean.

Antarctica is also home to Lake Vostok, one of the world's largest lakes. Lake Vostok is roughly the size of North America's Lake Ontario, but it is not a lake for sailing boats. It lies 2 miles (4 kilometers) below the continental ice sheet. Its waters have been sealed from air and light under the tremendous pressure of the continental ice sheet for perhaps as long as 35 million years.

                    <p>The water is as cold as salt water can be without freezeing, a balmy -1.8C  or 28F.  Prevailing knowledge would suggest that bacteria have enzymes which are not very good at those cold temperatures and thus the animals are better at digesting the labile compounds. Since the bacteria cannot digest the fresh food, the food stays fresh throughout the year until the next pulse of food.  The other idea is that the bacteria and animals compete for this labile compound, both as competitors, yet as the food turn refractory, the animals switch and start eating the bacteria.</p>

                        Spiophanes tcherniai is a species of Polychaete that occurs in incredible densities. To be exact in every square meter of sediment there are 150,000 to 180,000 individuals of this species as well as a variety of other species that we call ‘macrofauna.’ The macrofauna are visible to the eye but amazing under a microscope and all are, by definition, greater than 0.3mm in size.  Its an diverse community with small shrimp looking animals, worms of every shape and colors, not to mention clams and anemones.  They co-occur with an incredible variety of bacteria and what we really want to know with this research is whether the bacteria are competing with the animals or facilitating the persistance of these animals, allowing this incredible density in a veritable dessert of food.

                        Understanding the roll of bacteria is key. Animals have a relatively simple diet of what they can digest.  Easy to digest food (which we call labile) is usually fresh and not the most abundant form of carbon in the oceans. Refractory compounds are the dominant source of potential food but cannot be digested by animals without help.  Cows, for example, get help by special bacteria in their rumen giving them greater access to the food in grass.  In the Antarctic,  the shortage of food is really a shortage of ‘labile’ food.  Refractory compounds are present year round in the sediment.  Yet both bacteria and animals prefer the labile compounds and that leads to competition for a limiting food resource.
