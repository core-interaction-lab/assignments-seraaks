                        Even in the extreme environment of Antarctica, life not only survives but thrives. Its icy seas, isolated icebergs and snow-driven deserts are home to wildlife that surprise and charm all who visit them.

As a place of sub-zero temperatures and harsh winds, it is an understatement to say that Antarctica does not make for a very pleasant habitat. That is, at least, for most animals. But the animals that do live here aren’t like most animals. Each one of them is an inspiring story of adaptability, resilience and cooperation.

                        Due to their thick layer of blubber and fur, Antarctic seals are extremely well-adapted to the freezing conditions. They actually even find the climate too hot, often having to take plunges into the icy water to cool down.

                        By far the most abundant and therefore the most commonly seen seal in Antarctica is the crabeater, so named for their ability to devour krill, which could in turn be described as tiny crabs. The adorable Weddell seals spend most of their time below the surface but can be found on the ice during their breeding season (November – December).

                    <p>Antarctica is one of the world’s top whale-spotting places. During the Antarctic summer (October to March), there are about 10 species of whales that migrate south to Antarctica to breed and feed. February and March are generally considered the best months for whale watching, often having a greater variety of species and larger numbers to wow at.

                        From the moment we start crossing the Drake Passage, it is not uncommon to spot blue, fin, humpback, minke, orcas, and southern right and sperm whales close to the ship. And once we’re in the Antarctic Peninsula, they can appear out of nowhere and may even pop up right next to you when you are out on smaller explorer boats or kayaking.</p>

                    <p>While no land animals live in here, the surrounding ocean is home to an array of animals that visitors on Antarctica cruises might not expect to see. From albatross to leopard seals to the blue whale, these cold seas brim with life.</p>

                        Eight of the world’s 17 species of penguins can be found in Antarctica and in the sub-Antarctic area. They include Adélie, chinstrap, gentoo, king, macaroni, rockhopper, emperor and Magellanic penguins. Around twelve million penguins reside in the relatively mild conditions on the Antarctic Peninsula.

You will never forget going ashore to visit a penguin colony. Yes, they are very loud, and no one will ever describe their smell as enchanting, but you won’t care. Even if we are sure to keep our distance so as not to disturb them, witnessing these charming creatures shuffling around as they go about their business is something that will stay with you forever.

                        Penguins aren’t the only birds in Antarctica. This is a birdwatcher’s paradise that draws millions of birds across 46 species. From the deck of your expedition ship or when ashore during landings, keep your eyes peeled for wandering albatrosses, shearwaters, giant petrels, storm petrels, blue-eyed shags, diving petrels, cormorants, sheathbills, skuas, gulls and terns.
