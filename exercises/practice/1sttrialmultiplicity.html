        <h3>What if Instagram restricted the amount of advertisements appearing on the userâ€™s feed?</h3>
        <p1>It can be easy to get lost in the advertisements in our day and age of social media. It seems as its even harder to get away from ads, especially on certain platforms where the user feels as if the application is listening. My intention is to visualize how the user could use their voice to try to change something regarding these platforms. </p1><br>
