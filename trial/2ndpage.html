  <p id="one" style="margin-top: 260px;"> Frank Capra said, “Film is a disease.” I caught the disease early on. I felt it whenever I walked up to the ticket booth with my mother or my father or my brother. You’d go through the doors, up the thick carpet, past the popcorn stand that had that wonderful smell—then to the ticket taker, and then in some of the old theaters there would be another set of doors with little windows and you’d get a glimpse of something magical happening up there on the screen, something special. </p>
  <p id="two" style="margin-top: 260px;"> And as we entered, for me it was like entering a sacred space, a kind of sanctuary where the living world around me seemed to be recreated and played out. What was it about cinema? What was so special about it? I think I’ve discovered some of my own answers to that question a little bit at a time over the <a href="3rdpage.html">years.</p>
