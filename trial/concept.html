  <p id="concept" style="color:white">A Trick of <a href="index.html">Light</a> is based on "The Persisting Vision of Cinema", a visual essay written by writer and director Martin Scorcese. Scorcese, in his words, writes about the important elements of cinema, paired with his personal connotations with all these elements and the history of cinema. One of the reoccuring terms that kept catching my attention was his mentions of "light" and how it effects cinema and the viewer, and I felt like it held a lot of importance. I wanted to create an interaction that would amplify the significance of light in all areas, and how situations change with & without light present. Mostly the interactive websites focus on different colors of text that either are harder to read with the light, or easier, posing the viewer to understand how light changes what we see and understand.</p>
